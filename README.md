# Double-Pong-party-AC-2024
The game was coded during the AC 2024 speed coding.
From 9am (officially but more 11am in fact) the 13th of april 2024 to 3pm the 14th of april 2024. 

The theme was "Party Game about the 20th anniversary of the association" and the only restriction was that minimum one member of the association must appear in the game.

I made a two-player pong drinking/strip game for the Game Boy. 

Players have to be on the Game Boy's side and not in front of it. 
Player 1 moves his paddle with up and down, player 2 moves with A and B.

At the beginning of the game, you have a choice between playing as Xirius and Nhut or Fei and Marie.
Xirius and Nhut are two members of the association who like to drink at parties. They are the drinking mode of the game.
Fei and Marie, who are also members of the association, are the strip mode of the game because they are a couple.

If Nhut or Xirius reach 5 points, the loser has to drink 5 shooters.
Points are represented by small shooters on the side of each player.

If Fei or Marie reach 5 points, the loser must get naked.
T-shirts on the sides of players represent points.

And that's all!  We can play it at the next association event. :-D

Real homebrew coders helped me code this game for the Game Boy :

- matmook, the unofficial C teacher.
- Fadest and Vince helped me when I encountered a bug in the middle of the night.
- bjorn_nah added jokes to my code (I sadly had to erase) while I was at the bar.
